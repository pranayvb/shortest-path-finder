# shortest-path-finder
 Using A* algorithm, we did a simple implementation of the a-star path finding algorithm in python

# Features

-A Toolbar with the following tools:

-Move Tool (Selecting / Moving nodes)                                                                                                                                       
-Add Tool (Adding nodes)                                                                                                                                                  
-Connect Tool (Connecting nodes)                                                                                                                                                           
-Delete Tool (Deleting nodes therefore it's connections)                                                                                                                                      
-The ability to customize nodes (text / color / its connections weights)
